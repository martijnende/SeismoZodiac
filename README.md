# SeismoZodiac

A little weekend project just for fun: the `create_zodiacs.ipynb` notebook renders 12 seismology-inspired zodiac signs, based on the conventional astrological zodiac signs. Some examples are included below.

Since I am not an expert on astrology, I relied on [Co-Star](https://www.costarastrology.com/zodiac-signs) for the personal characteristics.
